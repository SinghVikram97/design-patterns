# Design Patterns in Java

This repository showcases various **Design Patterns** in Java, grouped into three main categories and problems related to them:
1. **Creational Patterns**  
2. **Structural Patterns**  
3. **Behavioral Patterns**

Below is a list of all patterns currently included, with links to their respective implementations in the codebase.

---

## 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The goal is to abstract the instantiation process.

- [Factory Method Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/factorymethoddesignpattern) 
- [Abstract Factory Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/abstractfactorypattern)
- [Singleton Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/singletonpattern)
- [Builder Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/builderpattern)   
- [Prototype Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/prototypepattern)

## 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- [Decorator Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/decoratorpattern)
- [Facade Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/facadepattern)  
- [Adapter Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/adapterpattern)
- [Proxy Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/proxypattern)
- [Bridge Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/bridgepattern)  
- [Composite Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/compositepattern)  
- [Flyweight Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/flyweightpattern)

## 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/chainofresponsibilitypattern)  
- [Command Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/commandpattern)
- [Iterator Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/iteratorpattern)  
- [Interpreter Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/interpreterpattern)  
- [Mediator Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/mediatorpattern)  
- [Memento Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/mementopattern)  
- [Observer Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/observerpattern)  
- [State Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/statepattern)  
- [Strategy Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/strategypattern)  
- [Template Method Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/templatemethodpattern)  
- [Visitor Pattern](src/main/java/org/vikram/visitorpattern)

## 4. Problems

- [Parking Lot](src/main/java/org/vikram/problems/parkinglot/Main.java)
- [Meeting Scheduler](src/main/java/org/vikram/problems/meetingscheduler/Main.java)
